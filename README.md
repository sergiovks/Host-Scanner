# Host-Scanner

# This is a host scanner script created in bash, for /24 nets, thought-out for pivoting internal networks from a Linux Host that you have access, you just need to create the scanner file in the Linux host that has internal networks that you want to scan and copy the script content in there and modify what you need.

# Usage: you have to change the IP of the localnet to scan for whatever you need, you can include the variable $i on the value of the IP that you want. It depends on you.
